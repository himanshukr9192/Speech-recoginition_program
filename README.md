🎙️ “Just Built a Speech Recognition App in Python! 🐍🗣️”

 It’s a simple yet powerful speech recognition app written in Python. 🐍🎤

🌟 In this project, I leveraged the SpeechRecognition library to capture audio from the microphone, recognize spoken words, and convert them into text. The magic happens through a combination of neural networks, feature extraction, and decoding techniques. 🧠🔊

🔍 If you’re curious about the nitty-gritty details, check out the code in the repository. From deep learning models to efficient feature handling, it’s all there! 💡

Feel free to explore, contribute, and let’s make voice technology even cooler together! 🚀
